## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
Learnt How to use CSS Flexbox and Grid

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development

Well, I will love to master how Css Grid and Flexx box works. Also how to centre Div class in Css. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS GRID](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me in Understanding How Css-Grid works. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS FLEXBOX](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS FLEXBOX. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
